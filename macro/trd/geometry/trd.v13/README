##   Howto generate a digipar file form a .root geometry
#

v13c - like v13b, but reduced FEBs: 10 FEBs for 1 cm2 and 5 FEBs for 2 cm2 pad size
v13d - like v13b, but FEB  0 degree inclination
v13e - like v13b, but FEB 30 degree inclination
v13f - like v13b, but FEB 60 degree inclination
v13g - like v13b, but FEB 80 degree inclination
v13h - like v13b, but no radiator material
v13i - like v13c, but FEB thickness reduced from 5.0 to 2.5 mm
v13j - like v13b, but no FEBs at all
v13k - like v13b, but no FEBs at all and no lattice grid

v13s - like v13a, SIS100 TRD, 2 layers, reduced number of FEBs, reduced FEB thickness
v13t - like v13s, SIS100 TRD, 4 layers, reduced number of FEBs, reduced FEB thickness
v13u - like v13s, SIS100 TRD, 2 layers, with 6 mm gas gap
v13v - like v13t, SIS100 TRD, 4 layers, with 6 mm gas gap
