TRD geometry v11a
D. Emschermann, June 2011

derived from v10b, with following changes:
- only 2 different module sizes, 60 cm x 60 cm and 100 cm x 100 cm
- changed layout of the inner part (3m x 3m) of TRD stations 1 and 2
- reduced the total number of TRD modules
- variable frame thickness of 15 mm / 20 mm
- results in pad plane size of 570 mm x 570 mm and 960 mm x 960 mm
- multiple of 30 mm allows for pad width of 5 mm or 7.5 mm

Number of stations: 3
Number of layers per station: 4
