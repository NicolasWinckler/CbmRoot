##   Information about trd.v13 geometries
#

# introduced new geometry naming scheme in May/June 2013, new geos:

- v13g - SIS 300, 10 layers, behind RICH (z = 3800 mm), compact layers (dz = 450 mm)
- v13h - SIS 300, 10 layers, behind MUCH (z = 5400 mm), compact layers (dz = 450 mm)
- v13i - SIS 100,  2 layers, behind RICH (z = 3800 mm), compact layers (dz = 450 mm)
- v13j - SIS 100,  3 layers, behind RICH (z = 3800 mm), compact layers (dz = 450 mm)
- v13k - SIS 100,  4 layers, behind RICH (z = 3800 mm), compact layers (dz = 450 mm)
- v13l - SIS 100,  4 layers, behind MUCH (z = 4500 mm), compact layers (dz = 450 mm)
- v13m - SIS 100,  4 layers, behind STS  (z = 2700 mm), parking for TOF

# created new official ROOT TRD geometries (21.03.2013)

- v13c - as v13i, compressed, without 25 cm gaps between stations, z = 4.5m to 9.5m
- v13d - as v13s - 2 layers, SIS100
- v13e - as v13r - 3 layers, SIS100
- v13f - as v13t - 4 layers, SIS100
