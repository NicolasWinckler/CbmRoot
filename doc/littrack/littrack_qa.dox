implemented no unit testing.

\section littrack_qasection1 Field approximation Qa

Polynomial field approximation is used in the SIMDized tracking implementation. 
Quality check of the magnetic field approximation is implemented in \c CbmLitCheckField 
class. Corresponding macro for running field approximation quality assurance is 
\c macro/littrack/check_field.C. For further information and parameter description 
please see comments in the class and macro.
