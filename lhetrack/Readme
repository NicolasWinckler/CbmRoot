CbmStsCandidTracker class --- simple hits and tracks maker from MC point
CbmStsCMTrackFinder class --- track finder class
CbmStsPolyFitter class    --- track fitter class 
few additional classes

It is tuned for FIELD.v03b.map now and involves only first steps for finding
tracks (~95% for primary and ~80% for secondary) and fitting (~1% $\delta$ p / p).

The output of LHEtrack is given in registered branch "CbmStsTrack"
in the form of CbmStsTrack class from /sts directory. 

Fitting in CbmPolyFitter could be switched on and off. The output correspondingly
will be filled with fit information for tracks and/or track hits numbers only.
